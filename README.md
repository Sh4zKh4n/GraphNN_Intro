# Introduction to Graph Convolutions [![Binder with JupyterLab](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-jupyterlab-red.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kmader/GraphNN_Intro/master?urlpath=lab)

Some introductory material for GraphNNs as sequential notebooks. The rendered output are available as PDFs in the [releases](https://github.com/kmader/GraphNN_Intro/releases) page and the raw notebooks are in the notebooks directory (or follow the links below).

## Notebooks

### [Basic Graph and Convolutions](notebooks/1-simple-graph-nn-overview.ipynb)
Simple examples of graphs and convolutions across them with the outputs shown at every step
### [From MNIST to Graphs](notebooks/2-create-graphs-from-mnist.ipynb)
The introduction to the MNIST digit classification toy problem and its adaptation for graphs.
### [GCN on Disjoint Graphs](notebooks/3-disjoint-MNIST-gcn.ipynb)
A real GCN-based problem for classifying digits using just the graph structure of the non-zero pixels.
### [GCN with XY positions](notebooks/4-disjoint-mnist-graph-with-xy.ipynb)
A real GCN-based problem for classifying digits using just the graph structure of the non-zero pixels.
