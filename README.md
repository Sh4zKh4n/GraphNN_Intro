# GraphNN_Intro [![Binder with JupyterLab](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-jupyterlab-red.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kmader/GraphNN_Intro/master?urlpath=lab)

Some introductory material for GraphNNs wrapped together from Kaggle kernels

## Notebooks

### [Basic Graph and Convolutions](notebooks/simple-graph-nn-overview.ipynb)
Simple examples of graphs and convolutions across them with the outputs shown at every step
### [From MNIST to Graphs](notebooks/create-graphs-from-mnist.ipynb)
The introduction to the MNIST digit classification toy problem and its adaptation for graphs.
### [GCN on Disjoint Graphs](notebooks/Disjoint-MNIST-Graph-Deep-Learning.ipynb)
A real GCN-based problem for classifying digits using just the graph structure of the non-zero pixels.
### [GCN with XY positions](notebooks/disjoint-mnist-graph-with-xy.ipynb)
A real GCN-based problem for classifying digits using just the graph structure of the non-zero pixels.
